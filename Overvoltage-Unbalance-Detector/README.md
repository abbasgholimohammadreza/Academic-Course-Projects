# Overvoltage & Unbalance Detection Circuit

Circuit course project (Semester 3).
This project designs a protection circuit to detect overvoltage and voltage imbalance in power systems.

## ✅ Single-phase Overvoltage Detection
- Voltage divider for safe scaling
- Low-pass filter to eliminate switching noise
- Half-wave rectifier + comparator threshold detection
- LED alarm with RC delay

## ✅ Three-phase Voltage Unbalance Detection
- Phase voltage scaling
- Summing amplifier for imbalance monitoring
- Worst-case phase-loss analysis

## Tools
- NI Multisim
- LM741 Operational Amplifier
